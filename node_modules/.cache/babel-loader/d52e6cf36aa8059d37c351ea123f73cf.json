         These sessions provide students with opportunites to meet company representatives in an \n                            informal setting and are avenues for companies to recruit students for permanent and \n                            internship positions, increasing company recognition among students. They are open to \n                            all students on campus. </p>\n                            <p> For those interested in hosting information sessions, please see our \n                            <strong> Company Recruiter Brochure</strong> \n                            and our\n                            <strong> FAQ</strong>.\n                            To host an information session, please click on the following button.\n                            For questions regarding company informations, please contact the Corporate Relations\n                            directors at cornell.swe.cr@gmail.com.

Ordering food and reserving a room is never a problem, however, it does\n                            take one week for room requests to be processed and confirmed. At least a week is necessary to properly \n                            publicize an information session and ensure the session has sufficient number of liaisons and volunteers. \n                            Since session details may take several days to finalize - especially if you have any questions about the \n                            session options - we recommend that session requests are made at least 14 days prior to the desired date. </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"question9\">\n                    <p className=\"question\">I am interested in the Professional Networking Dinner, how can I register for that?</p>\n                    <p> SWE proudly presents our semiannual Professional Networking Dinner.
